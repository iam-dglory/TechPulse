# Graveyard System - End-to-End Testing Guide

This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions for the Tech Graveyard system, including database setup, API endpoints, scheduled jobs, and mobile UI integration.

## üéØ **System Overview**

The Graveyard system tracks failed tech promises and overhyped claims with:

- **Graveyard Entries**: Failed projects with follow-up analysis
- **Editorial Workflow**: Admin interface for adding entries
- **Scheduled Jobs**: Automated reminders for high-hype story follow-ups
- **Mobile Interface**: Searchable graveyard with filtering and navigation

## üìã **Prerequisites**

### Backend Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# 2. Run database migrations
npm run typeorm:migrate

# 3. Start the backend server
npm run dev:ts:watch

# 4. Seed the database (optional)
npm run seed
```

### Mobile App Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
cd TexhPulzeMobile
npm install

# 2. Start the mobile app
npm start
```

### Admin User Setup

Ensure you have an admin user for testing:

```bash
# Create admin user via API
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "admin",
    "email": "admin@texhpulze.com",
    "password": "admin123",
    "isActive": true
  }'
```

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Create Graveyard Entry (Admin)**

#### Step 1: Submit Graveyard Entry via API

```bash
# Get admin auth token first
ADMIN_TOKEN="your_admin_jwt_token"

# Create graveyard entry
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/graveyard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "originalClaimStoryId": "existing-story-id",
    "companyId": "existing-company-id",
    "title": "Theranos Blood Testing Revolution",
    "followUpSummary": "Theranos claimed to revolutionize blood testing with a single drop of blood, promising faster, cheaper, and more accurate results than traditional lab testing.",
    "actualOutcome": "The company was exposed for fraud in 2015-2016. Their technology never worked as claimed. Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of fraud in 2022. The company dissolved in 2018.",
    "outcomeDate": "2022-01-03T00:00:00.000Z",
    "failureType": "broken-promise",
    "impactAssessment": {
      "usersAffected": 1000000,
      "financialImpact": "$9 billion valuation lost",
      "reputationDamage": "Severe damage to health tech credibility",
      "lessonsLearned": [
        "Due diligence in health tech claims",
        "Importance of peer review",
        "Regulatory oversight needed"
      ]
    },
    "originalPromises": "Revolutionary blood testing with single drop, faster results, cheaper costs, more accurate than traditional methods",
    "sources": [
      {
        "url": "https://example.com/theranos-fraud",
        "title": "Theranos Fraud Exposed",
        "date": "2022-01-03",
        "type": "news-report"
      }
    ],
    "isPublished": true
  }'
```

**Expected Result:**

- Status 201 with success response
- Graveyard entry created with all fields
- Entry marked as published with timestamp

#### Step 2: Verify Database Entry

```sql
-- Check graveyard table
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  failure_type,
  outcome_date,
  is_published,
  created_at
FROM graveyard
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check relationships
SELECT
  g.title,
  g.failure_type,
  s.title as original_story_title,
  c.name as company_name
FROM graveyard g
LEFT JOIN stories s ON g.original_claim_story_id = s.id
LEFT JOIN companies c ON g.company_id = c.id
WHERE g.title = 'Theranos Blood Testing Revolution';
```

### **Scenario 2: View Graveyard Entries (Public)**

#### Step 1: Get All Published Entries

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/graveyard" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Step 2: Search Entries

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/graveyard?search=theranos" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Step 3: Filter by Failure Type

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/graveyard?failureType=broken-promise" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

#### Step 4: Get Single Entry

```bash
GRAVEYARD_ID="graveyard-entry-id-from-previous-response"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/graveyard/$GRAVEYARD_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Results:**

```

### **Test Data Relationships**

#### Create Related Test Data

```bash
# 1. Create a high-hype story
STORY_ID=$(curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/stories" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Revolutionary AI That Will Change Everything",
    "content": "This AI promises to solve all problems...",
    "sectorTag": "AI",
    "hypeScore": 9,
    "ethicsScore": 3
  }' | jq -r '.data.story.id')

# 2. Wait 6 months (or manually set publishedAt in database)
# 3. Create graveyard entry referencing the story
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/graveyard" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{
    \"originalClaimStoryId\": \"$STORY_ID\",
    \"title\": \"AI Revolution Never Delivered\",
    \"followUpSummary\": \"The AI promised to revolutionize everything but never delivered.\",
    \"actualOutcome\": \"The AI was overhyped and underdelivered.\",
