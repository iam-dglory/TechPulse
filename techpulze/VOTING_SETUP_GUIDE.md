## =à Database Setup Required

Before testing, ensure your Supabase database has these tables:

### Required Tables:

#### 1. `votes` table
```sql
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) NOT NULL,
  company_id UUID REFERENCES companies(id) NOT NULL,
  vote_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (vote_type IN ('ethics', 'credibility', 'delivery', 'security', 'innovation')),
  score INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (score >= 1 AND score <= 10),
  weight DECIMAL(3, 2) DEFAULT 1.0,
  comment TEXT,
  evidence_urls TEXT[],
  voted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, company_id, vote_type)
);
```

#### 2. `companies` table (should have these score columns)
```sql
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ethics_score DECIMAL(3, 1) DEFAULT 5.0;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS credibility_score DECIMAL(3, 1) DEFAULT 5.0;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS delivery_score DECIMAL(3, 1) DEFAULT 5.0;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS security_score DECIMAL(3, 1) DEFAULT 5.0;
ALTER TABLE companies ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS innovation_score DECIMAL(3, 1) DEFAULT 5.0;
```

#### 3. `user_profiles` table (for vote weight calculation)
```sql
CREATE TABLE user_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  reputation_score INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  is_expert BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## =Ê Vote Weight System

User votes are weighted based on reputation:

```
Base weight: 1.0x

Reputation bonuses:
+0.2x if reputation >= 20
+0.5x if reputation >= 50
+1.0x if reputation >= 100

Expert multiplier:
×1.5x if is_expert = true

Maximum cap: 3.0x
```

**Example Calculations:**
- New user (rep: 0): **1.0x**
- Regular user (rep: 100): **1.1x**
- Analyst (rep: 500): **1.3x**
- Expert (is_expert: true): **2.0x**

---

## = Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Sign In to Vote" overlay not showing
**Solution:** Check that `userId` prop is `undefined` when not authenticated.

### Issue: Votes not submitting
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Supabase connection in `.env.local`
3. Check `votes` table exists in Supabase
4. Verify RLS policies allow inserts

### Issue: Scores not updating after vote
**Solution:**
- Scores update via database triggers (if configured)
- Or manually refresh: `router.refresh()` or `window.location.reload()`

### Issue: Dark mode colors look wrong
**Solution:**
- Ensure ThemeProvider wraps your app
- Check `suppressHydrationWarning` on `<html>` tag

### Issue: Slider styling broken
**Solution:**
- Custom slider CSS is injected via `<style jsx>`
- Check browser supports `::-webkit-slider-thumb`

---

## =Ý Usage Example

Here's how the VotingInterface is integrated in your company page:

```tsx
<VotingInterface
  companyId={params.id}
  companyName={company.name}
  currentScores={{
    ethics: company.ethics_score || 5,
    credibility: company.credibility_score || 5,
    delivery: company.delivery_score || 5,
    security: company.security_score || 5,
    innovation: company.innovation_score || 5,
  }}
  userPreviousVotes={userVotes || undefined}
  userId={userId}
  userWeight={userWeight}
  onVoteSubmitted={() => {
    router.refresh()
    window.location.reload()
  }}
/>
```

---

## <¯ Next Steps

### 1. Test the Component
Follow the **Testing Checklist** above to verify everything works.

### 2. Configure Database Triggers (Optional)
Set up automatic score recalculation:

```sql
-- Create function to recalculate company scores
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION recalculate_company_score()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Calculate weighted average for each dimension
  UPDATE companies
  SET
    ethics_score = (SELECT AVG(score * weight) FROM votes WHERE company_id = NEW.company_id AND vote_type = 'ethics'),
    credibility_score = (SELECT AVG(score * weight) FROM votes WHERE company_id = NEW.company_id AND vote_type = 'credibility'),
    delivery_score = (SELECT AVG(score * weight) FROM votes WHERE company_id = NEW.company_id AND vote_type = 'delivery'),
    security_score = (SELECT AVG(score * weight) FROM votes WHERE company_id = NEW.company_id AND vote_type = 'security'),
    innovation_score = (SELECT AVG(score * weight) FROM votes WHERE company_id = NEW.company_id AND vote_type = 'innovation')
  WHERE id = NEW.company_id;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Create trigger
CREATE TRIGGER update_company_scores
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE ON votes
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION recalculate_company_score();
```

### 3. Customize Styling (Optional)
Edit `src/components/voting/VotingInterface.tsx` to adjust:
- Colors
- Animations
- Layout
- Text content

### 4. Add Real-time Updates (Optional)
Enable live score updates when other users vote:

```tsx
useEffect(() => {
  const channel = supabase
    .channel(`company-${companyId}`)
    .on('postgres_changes', {
      event: 'UPDATE',
      schema: 'public',
      table: 'companies',
      filter: `id=eq.${companyId}`
    }, (payload) => {
      // Update scores in real-time
      setCurrentScores({
        ethics: payload.new.ethics_score,
        credibility: payload.new.credibility_score,
        // ... etc
      })
    })
    .subscribe()

  return () => supabase.removeChannel(channel)
}, [companyId])
```
