# 🔧 Deployment Fix Applied - 404 Error Resolution

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### **Problem Identified:**
The production build was using the `--turbopack` flag, which is **still in beta** for Next.js 15 and not stable for production deployments. This caused Vercel to fail building the application properly, resulting in the **404 NOT_FOUND** error.

### **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **package.json** - Removed Turbopack from Build
```json
// BEFORE (BROKEN)
"build": "next build --turbopack"

// AFTER (FIXED)
"build": "next build"
```

- ✅ **Dev mode still uses Turbopack** for faster local development
- ✅ **Production build now uses stable Next.js compiler**

#### 2. **vercel.json** - Simplified Configuration
```json
// BEFORE (UNNECESSARY)
{
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "devCommand": "npm run dev",
  "installCommand": "npm install",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  ...
}

// AFTER (CLEANER)
{
  "framework": "nextjs",
  ...
}
```

- ✅ Removed explicit build commands (Vercel auto-detects better)
- ✅ Removed region specification (Vercel optimizes automatically)
- ✅ Kept security headers and rewrites intact

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **If build still fails:**

1. **Check build logs in Vercel:**
   - Look for red error messages
   - Common issues:
     - Missing dependencies
     - TypeScript errors
     - Environment variables missing

2. **Verify environment variables are set:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
   - Ensure these are set:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

3. **Check Git branch:**
   - Vercel might be watching the wrong branch
   - Go to Settings → Git
   - Ensure "Production Branch" is set to: `revamp/texhpulze-2.0` or `main`

4. **Manual redeploy:**
   - In Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Click "⋯" (three dots) on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

### **If still getting 404 after successful build:**

1. **Check vercel.json configuration:**
   - Ensure `framework: "nextjs"` is set
   - No conflicting routes

2. **Check src/app structure:**
   - Ensure `page.tsx` exists in `src/app/`
   - Ensure all routes have proper `page.tsx` files

3. **Try hard refresh:**
   - Chrome/Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Firefox: `Ctrl + F5`
   - Safari: `Cmd + Shift + R`
